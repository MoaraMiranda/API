SQLite Database - rocketNotesAPI
Welcome to my first database project built with SQLite, Express, and Knex! In this README, I will provide an overview of the project and details about the technologies used.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to demonstrate practical usage of a relational database, utilizing SQLite as the database management system, Express as the web framework for creating endpoints, and Knex as the SQL query builder to facilitate interactions with the database.

Throughout this project, I learned about fundamental concepts of relational databases, such as primary keys and foreign keys, and how to model and organize data within interconnected tables.

Technologies Used
SQLite: An embedded relational database, ideal for smaller projects and rapid development.

Express.js: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of APIs and endpoints.

Knex.js: An SQL query builder that streamlines the construction and execution of SQL queries, allowing for more readable and organized query construction.

Beekeeper: an open source SQL editor.

Insomnia: to test the endpoints and interact with the database.
